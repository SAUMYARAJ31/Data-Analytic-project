# Data-Analytic-project
Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard is a data analytics project developed using Power BI to analyze electric vehicle adoption trends across the United States.
The project focuses on understanding EV growth by model year, vehicle type **(BEV vs PHEV)**, manufacturer, model, and state.
A publicly available EV registration dataset was cleaned and transformed to ensure data accuracy and usability.
Key performance indicators such as total vehicles, average electric range, and CAFV eligibility were created using DAX.
Interactive dashboards and slicers allow users to explore insights dynamically.
The analysis highlights market leaders, adoption patterns, and regional distribution of electric vehicles.
This project demonstrates hands-on experience in data cleaning, modeling, visualization, and analytical storytelling.
It is designed as a job-ready portfolio project suitable for data analyst roles.
