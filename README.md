Electric Vehicle Analysis Dashboard – Power BI
1. **Project Overview**

This dashboard analyzes Electric Vehicle (EV) adoption trends using Power BI.
It provides insights into total EV registrations, vehicle types, manufacturers, models, and geographic distribution across the United States.
The goal is to support data-driven understanding of EV market growth and adoption patterns.

2.**** Dataset & Data Preparation****

The analysis is based on a publicly available electric vehicle population dataset.
Data was cleaned, transformed, and modeled in Power BI to ensure accuracy and consistency.
Key fields include model year, make, model, vehicle type, electric range, state, city, and CAFV eligibility.

3.** Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**

Total Vehicles: 150.48K registered EVs

Average Electric Range: 67.88 km

BEV Vehicles: 117K (78% of total)

PHEV Vehicles: 34K (22% of total)

These KPIs provide a quick snapshot of overall EV adoption.

4.** Filter Panel**

Interactive slicers allow filtering by City, Electric Utility, and Electric Vehicle Type.
This enables dynamic exploration of the data at different levels of granularity.

5. **EV Growth Trend by Model Year**

A line chart visualizes total EV registrations by model year.
The trend shows steady growth with a significant increase in recent years, highlighting rising EV adoption.

6. **Geographic Analysis (State-wise)**

A filled map displays total EV registrations across US states.
This visualization helps identify regions with high and low EV adoption.

7. **Manufacturer Analysis**

A bar chart ranks manufacturers by total EV count.
Tesla leads the market, followed by Nissan, Chevrolet, Ford, and BMW, indicating strong brand dominance.

8. **Model-Level Analysis
**
A treemap highlights the most popular EV models.
Models such as Tesla Model Y and Model 3 contribute significantly to total registrations.

9.** CAFV Eligibility Analysis**

A donut chart shows vehicle distribution based on Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) eligibility.
This helps assess how many vehicles qualify for clean energy incentives.
